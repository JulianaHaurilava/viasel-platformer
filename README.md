# Viasiel

**Viasiel** is a computer game that started as a science conference project and later expanded into a more comprehensive university assignment. 

## Genre
2D platformer.

## Core Mechanics
- Jumping and dodging obstacles.
- Defeating enemies.
- Bonus Collection.

## Technologies
- Game Engine: Unity
- Programming Language: C#
- Version Control: Git

## My Role in the Project
I was responsible for the full development cycle of Viasiel, including:
- Designing and implementing game mechanics.
- Level design.
- Programming all game functionalities in Unity using C#.
- Sourcing design assets for the game.
- Testing the game.

## Project Development Process
### First stage

The project initially started as a presentation for a scientific conference held at BSUIR on May 17, 2023. 
I worked in a team of three, and our theme was "Game development with the GPT-3 neural network." 
In this beta version, all scripting and story-writing were handled by ChatGPT-3. My tasks included generating code, sourcing assets, and creating a demo level. 
The result was a mini-game where the player could jump, run, fight, and climb stairs.

Also our report was published in a [59-th scientific conference collection.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16696410/59-th.scientific.conference.pdf). You can find it on page 84.

### Second stage

Later, I was assigned a homework project to develop a game, covering all aspects of game development, including full documentation and prototyping. 
I've remembered about this project and desided to use it as a foundation. However, upon review, I realized the project was disorganized and code was really unclean, so I had to rewrite almost everything. Several changes were made:
- Improved code organization.
- Increased level count from 1 to 4.
- Added a main menu and settings.
- Integrated a bonus collection system.
- Enhanced the game with various joints, connectors, and effectors.
- Added a final cutscene.

## What's next

I've put a lot of work into this project, but I’m not planning to stop here. Originally, I created this game to bring attention to the fading Belarusian culture.
As you might have noticed, storytelling isn’t its strongest aspect. I plan to develop a richer narrative inspired by ancient Belarusian myths and legends. I also aim to create a unique design by drawing my own assets.


So, stay tuned if you want to see my dream come to life!
